##Feng etal., 2025. Fear of humans mediates spatiotemporal interactions between endangered large Asian felids.##

## **Data Files:**
There are 4 data files included in Excel that needed to run  Bayesian two-species occupancy model and temporal overlap across tiger, leopard, and 3 ungulates prey (sika deer, roe deer and wild boar).

**tiger_y_matrix** - The number of days tiger was detected  for each month (from Feb. to Sep. in 2029 year) and is supplied as data to the JAGS model so that this species detection probability can be calculated. 

**leopard_y_matrix** - The number of days leopard was detected for each month (from Feb. to Sep. in 2029 year)and is supplied as data to the JAGS model so that this species detection probability can be calculated. 


**humanRAI** - Site covariates used within our analysis: human relative abundacne index, as the number of detections per 100 camera trap days.

**species_activity**-All species (tiger, leopard, sika deer, roe deer and wild boar) temporal activity.
